                The city hosts numerous museums, including the National Women's Monument, the Anglo-Boer War Museum, the National Museum, and the Oliewenhuis Art Museum. Bloemfontein also

                Bloemfontein is popularly and poetically known as "the city of roses", for its abundance of these flowers and the annual rose festival held there. The city's Sesotho
                name is Mangaung, meaning "place of cheetahs". Its !Orakobab name is ǀʼAuxa ǃXās or ǀKxʼauxa ǃXās (Khoekhoegowab spelling: ǀAuxa !Khās), which refers to Jan Bloem II, known
                as !Xās-aob or Blumtseb who was a gaokxʼaob di kx'amkx'aob (chief's right hand) of the ǀŪdiǁʼais (Springbok Clan) of the !Ora ("Korana") nation, whose kraal was the original
                settlement before the city was built.

                <h2>Naval Hill</h2>
                <p>An extremely popular spot providing excellent views of the town and the Franklin Game Reserve forms part of the hill. Several types of big and small game can be seen in their natural habitat.
                    Bloemfontein could well be the only city in the world that has a game reserve in the heart of the city. Contrary to popular belief, the two naval guns are no longer on Naval Hill. The Naval 
                    Brigade took the canons with them after the Anglo-Boer war ended. The only visible evidence of Naval Hill's war history is a White Horse on the eastern hillside. The White Horse was an important
                    landmark for soldiers during the war.Dominating the Bloemfontein skyline, standing proudly in the heart of the City of Roses is Naval Hill. Standing atop this geographic wonder, you are provided
                    with an exquisite panoramic view of Bloemfontein. Located within the Franklin Game Reserve, it is known for both its natural beauty and its historical significance.

                <h2>National Museum</h2>
                <p>  The National Museum in Bloemfontein dates back to the 1870s, when its collections and displays comprised mainly rarities from around the world. It was established on 20 July 1877 and opened to the
                     public on 20 May 1878. The old Raadsaal building was made available by the then Free State Volksraad for hosting the Museum collections. A new museum building was completed in 1913 and the official
                    opening took place in 1915. Since 1881 the museum has been subsidised mainly by government. Through donations, purchases and exchange agreements the Museum’s collections slowly got established and
                     grew to a wide variety of natural and human science artefacts. The first honorary curator was Dr Hugh Exton. The first director, Dr E.C.N. van Hoepen, was appointed in January 1922. Staff numbers 
                     increased from six permanent members in 1951 to 130 members in 1985.
